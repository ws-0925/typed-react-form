- ‚úîÔ∏è **Completly type-checked**: make less errors, this library was built for Typescript. Supports nested objects/arrays.
- ü§î **Simple**: An intuitive, unclottered and easy to understand api. Well [documented](https://codestix.github.io/typed-react-form/) too (+JSDoc). 
- :fire: **Fast**: only rerenders the fields that change. This allows you to create huge forms.
- üì¶ **Pretty Small**: [![NPM Size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/typed-react-form)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=typed-react-form)

## Install

```  
npm install typed-react-form
```

## [Documentation here](https://codestix.github.io/typed-react-form/)

## Javascript/typescript React

This library is built from the ground up for React with typescript, but it also works with with vanilla React, without enforced type checking.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

1. Clone this repo
2. Install deps using `yarn`. Yarn is required because of the resolutions field in package.json, npm does not support this.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to `testing/`, run `yarn` and `yarn start` to start the testing application.
4. Done! When you edit source code, it will be rebuilt and update the testing application.
