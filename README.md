This library is built from the ground up for React with typescript, but it also works with with vanilla React, without enforced type checking.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

1. Clone this repo
2. Install deps using `yarn`. Yarn is required due to the resolutions field in package.json, npm does not support this.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to `example/`, run `yarn` and `yarn start` to start the testing application.
4. Done! When you edit source code, it will be rebuilt and update the testing application.
