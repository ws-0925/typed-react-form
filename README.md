## Javascript/typescript React

This library is built from the ground up for React with typescript, but it also works with with vanilla React, without enforced type checking.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

To begin developing yourself, clone this repo, and do the following:
- `/`: contains the library source code. Use `yarn start` or `npm run start` to watch the files and build each time something changes. This way the testing application gets updated each time.
- `example/`: contains the testing React app. Use `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start the application.
